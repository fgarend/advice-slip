# advice-slip

## Overview

Advice Slip is a tiny static page that fetches a random piece of advice from the [Advice Slip API](https://api.adviceslip.com). It uses a modular structure with separate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files for better performance and maintainability.

## Usage

1. Download or clone the repo.
2. Run a simple static server (e.g. `npx serve`) or use `npm run build && npx serve build` so the browser can call the API without CORS issues.
3. Visit the served page to see the latest advice.

## License

See `LICENSE` for details.
